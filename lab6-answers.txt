Worker:

To run the workers, I run the query by converting the query to a
collectproducer.

====================================================================================

localizeQueryPlan:

It's necessary to check the type of the query plan. If the query plan
is a SeqScan, then it is reset by a tableId and the Alias of SecScan.
If the query plan is a Operator, it can be check whether it's a Producer
or a Consumer. If it's a Producer It can be simply set the worker to this
worker. If it's a Consumer, then it's used to set the buffer of the plan.
I assign an array of OpIterator call children to store the children value
from the query plan. For each children it's necessary to recursively check
all its descendant to traversal all the node in the tree.

ShuffleProducer:

To run the ShuffleProducer, I assign three maps to store the relationship for
worker-IoSession, worker-buffer and worker-time. For each worker, I assign an
initial value for all maps. By starting with the first OpIterator child, I
first check if it's not null. Then use the information obtain from the child
